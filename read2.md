 ## The Difference Between Text Editors and IDEs:
 
1. A text editor kind of gives away what it does in the title—it edits text.
It also manages text, and manages files. 

2. IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of
different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file
manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.
